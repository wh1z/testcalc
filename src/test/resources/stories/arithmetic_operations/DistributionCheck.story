Narrative:
As a calculator user
I want to distributive property of operations to be as expected
So that calculation results are correct according/regardless the order of operands

!--TODO add scenarios to check the distributive property of operations
!-- 2*(1+3)=(2*1)+(2*3)
!-- (1+2)*3=(1*3)+(2*3)
!-- 2*(1-3)=(2*1)-(2*3)
!-- (1-2)*3=(1*3)-(2*3)
!-- 2/(1+3)!=(2/1)+(2/3)
!-- (1+2)/3!=(1/3)+(2/3)
!-- (1-2)/3!=(1/3)-(2/3)
